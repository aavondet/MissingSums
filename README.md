# Missing Sums

Given a subset of the set A=[0, 1, 2, ... , n] for some n a natural number, we are interested in seeing what "sums" are realized, and which ones are not. 

We define A+A={c | c=a+b, where a,b are elements of A }.
This set has been studied a lot and the number of missing sums were studied extensively, yet not much has been done with the missing sums of A+A+A+A. We aim to tackle this set which is a restricted version of A+A.
